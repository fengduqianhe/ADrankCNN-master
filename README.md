    Pytoch implementation of rankCNN for brain disease prognosis

    The code was written by Hezhe Qiao and Dr. Lin Chen, Department of Radiology at Chongqing Institute of Green\
     and Intelligent Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

1. Introduction

  
2. Prerequisites
Linux python 3.7 Pytorch version 1.2.0 NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN (CPU mode, untested) Cuda version 10.0.61
 

3.Dataset
The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that is avaiable at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ .
SID and IMAGE_ID in this file can be used to find the corresponding subjects and MRIs.  MMSE at four time points are also avaiable in ADNIMERGE_ADNI1 and ADNIMERGE_ADNI1

4.Pre-process
All MRIs were prepocessed by a standard pipeline in CAT12 toolbox which is avaiable at http://dbm,neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/.
